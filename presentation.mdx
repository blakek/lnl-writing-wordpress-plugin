# WordPress - Writing a Plugin

---

## Should I write a plugin?

---

### Should I write a plugin?

<div>

Never modify:

- WordPress core files (`wp-includes/`)
- your parent theme (`wp-content/themes/`)
- another plugin (`wp-content/plugins/`)

</div>

<Notes>

Should I write a plugin as opposed to modifying another file.

Basically, the only other maintainable option is extending the child theme.

- there's no hard rule to this
- generally, don't touch files that aren't managed by us
- (see list of things not to modify)
  - no reason to modify core files
  - parent theme can generally be replaced by copying a template into a child theme
  - Changing a poorly-written plugin is most difficult.
    - If it's a good plugin, it should use hooks (we'll talk about later)
    - If it's bad, consider cloning it to a new plugin

</Notes>

### Should this feature go in the child theme?

<div>

Rule of thumb:

- Theme-specific? üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Add to child theme instead
- Specific one-time override? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Use best judgment
- Overly-complicated site? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Use best judgment
- Otherwise, a plugin would probably work well

</div>

Note: most style changes can go in your child theme

<Notes>

As mentioned before, the only other maintainable option is extending the child theme.

Again, there's no hard rule.

(see guidelines from slide)

On real-world sites, it often makes sense to put non-theme overrides in the child theme. Realistically, these changes may only live as long as the chosen theme.

I lean to using the child theme for a lot. Really, it depends more on how the site is setup and how easy it is to write a plugin vs. extend the child theme.

Worried about losing logic when changing themes? When migrating to a new theme, your child theme is essentially a record of everything that changed.

## What is a plugin?

---

### What is a plugin?

- a folder in the `wp-content/plugins` directory
- a file in that directory with [certain comments](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/header-requirements/) at the top
- _traditionally_, entry file is named same as parent directory
  - e.g. `plugins/hello-world/hello-world.php`

<Notes>

Technically a single file in `wp-content/plugins` also works, but it's good to use a folder in case you need to add additional logic.

Minimal plugin: `example-plugins/1-hello-world/hello-world.php` [[example-plugins/1-hello-world/hello-world.php]]

[Here's header requirements](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/header-requirements/)

</Notes>

---

### How does it run?

WordPress loads plugins by searching through<br />
`wp-content/plugins` for files with header comments

<Notes>

Directory containing multiple plugins: `example-plugins/2-wordpress-searches-multiple-files`

## Gotchas

---

### Gotchas

(Most are related to PHP)

- PHP‚Äôs scoping is‚Ä¶ different
- naming collisions

<Notes>

See [plugin best practices](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/best-practices/)

For us, PHP in general would be a gotcha. It's simply not in our bench strength.

</Notes>

---

### Gotchas

```php
$test = 42;

function show_test() {
	echo $test;
	// Error: Undefined variable '$test'
}
```

---

## Hooks

---

### Hooks

Two kinds:

- actions
- filters

---

### Hooks: Actions & filters

Generally:

- both use callback functions to work
- actions "interrupt" code flow to do something; filters modify data for later use
- actions don‚Äôt return data; filters do
- actions have side-effects; filters shouldn't

---

### Hooks: Actions & filters

Let others extend your work:

- [`do_action()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/)
- [`apply_filters()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/apply_filters/)

---

### Hooks: Real examples

- [Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/hooks/)
- [Events Calendar/Tickets/etc.](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/)
- [Salient Theme](http://themenectar.com/docs/salient/developer-docs/)
